# gscramble-paper-pigs

Invasive wild pig data and scripts used in the gscramble publication - the gscramble package is [available on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gscramble/index.html).

The analysis of the pig data involved 3 main steps. Details of the code used in each step can be found in the corresponding section below:

1) [Admixture analysis of the empirical pigs](https://github.com/mgdesaix/gscramble-paper-pigs/blob/main/scripts/01_empirical_admixture/README.md)

2) [gscramble simulations of the empirical genotypes](https://github.com/mgdesaix/gscramble-paper-pigs/blob/main/scripts/02_gscramble_simulations/README.md)

3) [Summarizing results](https://github.com/mgdesaix/gscramble-paper-pigs/blob/main/scripts/03_results_summary/README.md)
